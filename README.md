# Find Your Favorite Color!!

This project is made entirely by me, for use of future students in the ECE 5 class, Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering, at University of California San Diego. In this project, I designed a complete Lab Assignment that tests studentsâ€™ conceptual understandings of **voltage divider using potentiometers, Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Signals, and how to use Arduino to adjust the duty cycle of the signals.**

The goal of this challenge is to have three potentiometers controlling the intensity of the Red, Green, and Blue LED of the RGB LED to produce the 8 colors shown in the image below. Then, you can adjust the intensity as much as you want until you found your favorite color! 

If you would like to look at the questions for this project, then navigate to the Challenge Questions file.

Below are images of the 8 colors you need to get by altering the potentiometer. Have fun!
